Quick Plot of Illinois' abortion rate

```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
require(knitr)

# setwd("~/Google Drive/100 - Publicly hosted/rootR/Bioinformatics")
# opts_knit$set(root.dir = "..")

## Sets output for figures
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=12, fig.height=8, fig.path='Figures/',
                      echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center')
```

These are the required packages:   
```{r LOAD | Packs}
packs = c("dplyr", "reshape2", "ggplot2", "ggthemes")
sapply(packs, require, character.only=TRUE)  

source("~/Github/Citations/Citation Function.R")
```

## Load our data frame

From State of Illinois' Open Access data   
```{r LOAD | Data}
df.abortion <- read.csv(
  "https://data.illinois.gov/api/views/f7nd-jj28/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
)
```

```{r BUILD | data frame}

df.abortion <- melt(data = df.abortion, id.vars = "YEAR", 
                    variable.name = "Year", value.name = "Abortions") %>%
  rename(Group=YEAR)
  

df.abortion$Year      <- as.integer(gsub("X", "", df.abortion$Year, ignore.case = T))
df.abortion$Abortions <- as.integer(df.abortion$Abortions)


df.abortion.ages <- subset(df.abortion, grepl(pattern = "Age", Group, ignore.case = T))
```

## Plot of Abortions vs Time For Each Age Group

```{r, Abortion01}
ggplot(df.abortion.ages, 
       aes(x=Year, y=Abortions/1000, color=Group)) + 
  geom_smooth() + geom_point(alpha=0.25) +
  theme_gdocs() + labs(x="Year", y="Number of abortions \n(thousands)", 
                       title="Abortions in State of Illinois")

# Public_Health
Various public health projects that I've started

## Abortions
[Abortion.Rmd](https://github.com/HunterRatliff1/Public_Health/blob/master/Abortion.Rmd): 
A few quick plots of Illinois' abortion rate, using the State of Illinois' 
Open Access data. The figure is outputed as a .png under 
[/Figures/Abortion01-1.png](https://github.com/HunterRatliff1/Public_Health/blob/master/Figures/Abortion01-1.png),
and as a html file under [Abortion.html](https://github.com/HunterRatliff1/Public_Health/blob/master/Abortion.html).

## Hospital Costs
[Hospital Costs.Rmd](https://github.com/HunterRatliff1/Public_Health/blob/master/Hospital%20Costs.Rmd):
Two quick plots illustrating some data on US hospital costs/discharges by 
state. Again, these figures are available as stand alone .png files under
the [/Figures/](https://github.com/HunterRatliff1/Public_Health/blob/master/Figures/)
subdirectory, or as an incomplete 
[Hospital_Costs.html file](https://github.com/HunterRatliff1/Public_Health/blob/master/Hospital_Costs.html).
